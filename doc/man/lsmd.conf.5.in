.SH NAME
lsmd.conf - libStorageMgmt daemon lsmd configuration file.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The libStorageMgmt plugin-in daemon(\fBlsmd\fR) will read \fBlsmd.conf\fR
file in the folder defined via \fB--confdir\fR(default is \fB/etc/lsm/\fR).

The \fBlsmd\fR also read plugin configuration files from sub-folder
\fBpluginconf.d\fR. The plugin configuration file should be named as
<uri_scheme>.conf. For example:

    * Linux plugin(\fBlinux\fR://):         \fBlinux.conf\fR
    * MegaRAID plugin(\fBmegaraid\fR://):   \fBmegaraid.conf\fR

The \fBlsmd.conf\fR controls the global settings for \fBlsmd\fR while
plugin configuration file controls plugin behaviour.

Each option line of configuration file should contain tailing
semicolon(\fB;\fR).
